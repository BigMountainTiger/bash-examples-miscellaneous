git-cherry-pick - Apply the changes introduced by some existing commits

Cherry pick a merge commit --
-m <parent-number>
--mainline <parent-number>
Usually you cannot cherry-pick a merge because you do not know which side of the merge should be considered the mainline. This option specifies the parent number (starting from 1) of the mainline and allows cherry-pick to replay the change relative to the specified parent.
