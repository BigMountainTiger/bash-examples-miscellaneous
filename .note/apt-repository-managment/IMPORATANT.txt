1. The Ubuntu version need to add to the source URL, so the correct debian packages can be retrieved from the repository
2. The "gpg" file is not an HTTPS certificate, it is used to verify that the packages downloaded is not un-authorised altered
    - We can set the source URL to a proxy, as long as we have the original "gpg", we can safely install packages
3. ppa-purge
