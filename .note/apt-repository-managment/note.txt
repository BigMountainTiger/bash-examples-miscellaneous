1. Need to know the Ubuntu version
    => cat /etc/lsb-release
    => cat /etc/upstream-release/lsb-release for linux mint

IMPORTANT - The Ubuntu version need to add to the source URL, so the correct debian packages can be retrieved from the repository

2. Ubuntu repositories are managed in the /etc/apt/ directory

3. The "sources.list" file is phasing out starting from Ubuntu "24.04"
cat sources.list => # Ubuntu sources have moved to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ubuntu.sources

4. The "sources.list.d/" directory has the repository information:
    ".list" files and ".source" files

cat ubuntu.sources =>

Types: deb
URIs: http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/
Suites: noble noble-updates noble-backports
Components: main restricted universe multiverse
Signed-By: /usr/share/keyrings/ubuntu-archive-keyring.gpg

--- the source file can also embed the gpg inline in the file

    - Main - Officially supported software.
    - Restricted - Supported software that is not available under a completely free license.
    - Universe - Community maintained software, i.e. not officially supported software.
    - Multiverse - Software that is not free.

5. the "gpg" file
    - It is important to know what the "gpg" file is not an HTTPS certificate, it is used to verify that
        the packages downloaded is not un-authorised altered

6. Add a ppa - https://launchpad.net/~deadsnakes/+archive/ubuntu/ppa


AUTOMATICALLY - The following commands add both the source and the "gpg" file

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
    sudo apt update

MANUALLY - It is possible to manually add a repository

    - https://askubuntu.com/questions/1312464/how-to-get-the-gpg-key-for-a-repository
    
    1. Go to the page of the owner/name PPA on Launchpad: https://launchpad.net/~owner/+archive/ubuntu/name.
        
    2. Look for signing key's fingerprint on the page. In the page there should be a section "Fingerprint:" with the key fingerprint printed below.
        You may need to click on "Technical details about this PPA" to see it.

    3. Download the PPA key into a specific directory on your system.
        - Download the key via the URL https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x<fingerprint>, 
        where <fingerprint> is the value you found in step 2.

        - Dearmor the key and put it in /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/owner_ubuntu_name.gpg.
            1. Name the downloaded file as "<repository-name>.asc"
            2. gpg --dearmor <repository-name>.asc => generate a file named <repository-name>.asc.gpg
            3. copy the file to any of the following directory "/etc/apt/keyrings", "/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d", or "/usr/share/keyrings".

    4. Create a file /etc/apt/sources.list.d/owner-ubuntu-name.list with these contents:
        deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/owner/name/ubuntu <codename> main
        where <codename> is what lsb_release -sc gives.


The following command purge a repository by "ppa-purge"
    sudo apt install ppa-purge - if not installed
    sudo ppa-purge deadsnakes
