1. The vscode has good git support by itself

2. The Timeline can show the changes on each commit on each individual file
    - "workbench.localHistory.enabled": false to disable timeline to show the state of each local "save" on the file
    
3. The git history "extension" can list branch history

4. The gitlens "extension" seems to be over heavy-weight for normal use
