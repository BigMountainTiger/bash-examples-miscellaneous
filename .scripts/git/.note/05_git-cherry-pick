git-cherry-pick - Apply the changes introduced by some existing commits

Cherry pick a merge commit --
-m <parent-number>
--mainline <parent-number>
Usually you cannot cherry-pick a merge because you do not know which side of the merge should be considered the mainline. This option specifies the parent number (starting from 1) of the mainline and allows cherry-pick to replay the change relative to the specified parent.

1. It is possible cherry pick to introduce conflicts
2. The cherry-pick creates a new commit hash totally different from the commit was picked
3. You can specify multiple commits to pick, if conflict happens, you need to resolve it one by one
4. The "-n" option does not commit the pick, giving you the option to create a single commit for the list of the commit hashes provided

* git cherry-pick allows you to pick any commit, even the parent commit of the current HEAD
* this can lead to un-desirable result
