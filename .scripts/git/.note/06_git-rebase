git-rebase - Reapply commits on top of another base tip

1. Rebase is similar to 3 way merge
2. Rebase applies all the commits after the common ancestor on top of the commit to rebase to
3. It applies the commits one by one. If conflict occurs for multiple commits, you need to resolve it one by one
4. If you take all the "current changes" during a conflict resolution, the commit is skipped
5. Unlike merge, there is no rebase commit
6. Rebase modifies the commit history, it is not suitable to use in a shared branch

It may be a good idea to squash (git rebase -i) all the commits before the rebase to resolve the conflict only once

git add .
git rebase --continue

to resolve the conflict
