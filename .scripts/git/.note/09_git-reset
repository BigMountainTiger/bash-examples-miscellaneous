git-reset - Reset current HEAD to the specified state

--soft
    Does not touch the index file or the working tree at all (but resets the head to <commit>, just like all modes do). This leaves all your changed files "Changes to be committed", as git status would put it.

--mixed - default
    Resets the index but not the working tree (i.e., the changed files are preserved but not marked for commit) and reports what has not been updated.

--hard
    Resets the index and working tree. Any changes to tracked files in the working tree since <commit> are discarded. Any untracked files or directories in the way of writing any tracked files are simply deleted.


"reset" is a powerful operation
We can commit after a reset, this will update the commit tree of the branch
